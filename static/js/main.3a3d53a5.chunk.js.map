A Business Day means any day other than Sunday or a day declared as holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 or a day on which normal business could not be transacted due to storms, floods, strikes, riots or any other events as Augmont may specify from time to time.<br/>\r\n●      To start the SIP, the member needs to log in to his/her account, click on the SIP link and fill in a simple form specifying the choices and submit. After successfully submitting SIP application, the member will get a confirmation sms/email.<br/>\r\n●      The member can start their SIP with the minimum amount of Rs. 1000 per month and can invest in multiples of Rs.1000 thereafter.<br/>\r\n●      The member gets an option to buy additional quantities of gold and silver in the existing SIP and the said quantity shall be added to the SIP quantity for the tenure.

However, if they choose the SIP cycle date as 5th of each month, then the SIP start date will be 5th November.<br/>\r\n●      One cannot change the amount of SIP, duration and cycle date once the request is submitted. In order to change one has to terminate the existing SIP and register for a new one. There are no charges currently for doing the same.<br/>\r\n●      The frequency of buying is once per month.

SIP will be terminated only upon the completion of the current SIP cycle month. e.g. If the member has selected 5th of every month as his SIP cycle date and his SIP is active, and the member decides to exit the SIP on 10th of the month, the cycle will continue till 4th of next month and then terminate.<br/>\r\nAt the end of SIP tenure or on SIP termination, the member may sell the gold and silver at the market price displayed on the Platform.

Within the grace period, if you do not transfer sufficient funds in your account, then your SIP may be treated as ’defaulted’ and your SIP may be irreversibly terminated.<br/>\r\n●      The SIP is neither a financial product nor a deposit scheme but a disciplined method of accumulating Gold/Silver.
