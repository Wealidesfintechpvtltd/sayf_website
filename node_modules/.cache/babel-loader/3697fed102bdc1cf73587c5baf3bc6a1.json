Within the grace period, if you do not transfer sufficient funds in your account, then your SIP may be treated as ’defaulted’ and your SIP may be irreversibly terminated.<br/>\r\n●      The SIP is neither a financial product nor a deposit scheme but a disciplined method of accumulating Gold/Silver.
