<p>The history of gold in India is quite old, and we see it as more than an investment. The yellow metal is well connected with our culture and tradition and is in every Indian heart. In India, the beauty and mysterious shrine of this metal are liked by people across the globe. The obsession with gold jewelry grows stronger with every passing time and era.</p>

<p>When it comes to gold consumption, Indians are top on the international list, increasing on auspicious days like Diwali &amp; Dhanteras. Families having low incomes too find an alternative to buy gold, making it an essential part of our living irrespective of gold rates in a particular city or village.</p>

<p>According to research and survey data, India consumes 23,000-24,000 tonnes of gold, most of which are owned by households. However, what is the reason behind such a massive demand for gold? How is it now moving towards a digital platform? How it affects the country's economy. Let's know about all of them in detail. &#8205;</p>

<h2>Rich History of Yellow Metal Gold </h2> <p>Since the beginning of human civilization, we have added montreal value to different things. Initially, we were following a barter system or, in simple words, an exchange system where one can exchange things with others under certain agreements.  &#8205;However, the problem noticed in this system is that the monetary value of different goods depends on the hard work required. For example, working in the field and sewing clothes are two different areas, and monetary value didn't match in any way. Moving on, humans have also used the shell as money because of its rare presence and allure. Animal furs are also used for money, but it is difficult to find or kill animals.</p>

<p>Now that gold came into existence, some of the golden materials found are dated 4000 years back. Gold is used as a reward, showing financial potential and liquidity worldwide. The use of gold in various uses and industries is part of mesmerizing and fascinating history.</p>

<p>Gold doesn't catch fire, or it doesn't poison or irradiate the person wearing it, making it a more suitable metal for jewelry. However, the overproduction of gold is a matter of concern. People can have it in different forms, such as bricks, coins, bars. Hence gold was used as a valuable form of money for the most prolonged period before we didn't have a specific currency to make everything simple for living. To know the purity of gold and its protection, people used to weight and purity standards in early civilization.</p>

<p>According to the World Gold council standards, most of the world's currencies were locked to gold at a fixed price per ounce by the late 19th century.</p>

<p>What does Gold Standard Refer to?  &#8205;Gold Standard refers to the process of using gold to determine the value of any currency. It fixes the rate of buying or selling gold to know the worth of any specific country's currency. &#8205;</p>

<p>Advantages of Gold Standard: High degree consistency and stability of gold prices  Easy to avoid deflationary and inflationary pressures It helps in the economic stability of the country No need for gold coins for transaction Make a strong foundation and trust in global trade.</p>

<p><b> However, we are not using the Gold standard in the current world. </b></p>

<p>After following the Gold standard, economists observe the increase in financial instability and inflation. Moreover, the prices of gold started rising again due to the repeated stock market crash in the early days of the 21st century. These all make economists think about the revision and changes in Gold standards as they have few intrinsic flaws. Many people are still unaware that gold is money and is frequently associated and valued in the US dollar.</p>

<p>The increased demand for Gold across the globe depends on 4 different factors: 1) Jewelry 2) Central bank reserves 3) Investment 4) Technology</p>

<p>Gold is a financial asset that has held its worth for ages and even during high inflation in the market. &#8205; The trading of Gold in India is done on Multi Commodity Exchange(MDX)</p>

<h3> Gold and Economy </h3><p> Gold affects the country's economy directly or indirectly, whether in the trading stage, refining stage, production stage, mining stage, or more. Let's dive in to know more about all factors: 
   <br /> <br /> <h3>Gold Imports is Responsible for the Decline in Value of Currency </h3>
     Any currency value is affected directly by the export and import of gold. If the import value is lesser than the export, currency value increases. In contrast, if the import value is more, it will decline the currency value.&#8205;Similarly, the rise in the rate of gold is inversely proportional to currency value. <br /> <br /> <h3>Interest Rates</h3> Interest rates are also somewhat related to gold prices. A low-interest rate on saving makes gold an alternate for a high return investment.</p>

<p><h3>Inflation </h3> &#8205;The value of bonds, fixed-income investments, stocks, and more are adversely affected by inflation, making gold a tempting option for investment.Inflation is the concern with a period of economic disruption, so the investors find gold to be a secure option that can sustain every situation and give a sense of financial stability.

<p><h2>Digitalization of Gold Investment </h2> The shift of money from physical to digital form is a new norm. Only 8% of the currency is available in physical form in today's world.</p>

<p>Gold is also moving on with this digital world at a rapid pace. From being available in physical form, now one can buy the digital gold easily in no time with the help of their smartphone.</p>

<p>(GAPs)Gold Accumulation Plans allow investors to buy gold in a fraction such as 0.1 grams; however, while purchasing it offline, it becomes expensive due to its handling costs.</p>
